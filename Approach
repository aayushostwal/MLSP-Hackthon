The data set contains 16 features. many of them have categorical values and id's & age have numerical values.
Set also contains missing values in 2 of the feature

TASK: to predict whether a trainee should get passed or not.
Steps :
    1. Used Visualizations to withdraw some pattern & relation between missing values and other features and profoundly found some!
            used distribution plots and count plots for univariate analysis.
            used hue and violin plots for bivariate analysis.
    2. After missing value imputation, Feature Engineering helped for data set get prepared for Modelling -
            used count-encoding (categorical values get replace by their count in the dataset )
            used One-hot encoding for binary categorical variables like Gender, is_handicapped.
    3. Normalization 
    4. Modeling - (Logistic regression, Random forests, XG Boost)
    5. Parameter Tuning
            Among the above three, Random forests were the most accurate.
            tune its 3 parameters :
                            max_leaf_nodes
                            max_depth
                            n_estimators
